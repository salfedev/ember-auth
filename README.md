# Ember Auth0

#### Walkthrough
* Generate route for listing users:
  `e g route users`
* Generate a model:
  `e g model user`
* 


#### Notes on Ember 2.*
* The goal of Ember 2 is to remove badly designed and unnecessarily complicated code from Ember 1. And apps that run on Ember 1.13 without any deprecation warnings should run without issues on Ember 2.0.Â 
* Components must have at least one dash in their name, e.g active-list. This helps Ember differentiate it from native HTML tags.
